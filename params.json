I do like Arduino as a form factor and don't like as IDE. Thus I decided to design this board to fulfil my not so sophisticated expectations: keep compatibility with original Arduino Uno and no support for programming via USB (ISP FTW!).\r\n\r\n`poorDuino`'s name comes from reduced manufacturing costs (i.e. no USB programmer onboard). It might be decreased more, but it would not fulfill my needs.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n* Arduino UNO board shape,\r\n* Connectors are fully compatible with Arduino standard,\r\n* Two power supply: 5V and 3V3 (selected via jumper),\r\n* Extra pull-up resitors on IIC lines (enabled by soldering jumper on bottom of the board),\r\n* USB connector and USB2UART bridge removed,\r\n* ICSP connector for programming (external programmer is necessary)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n1.
